Apps Page
=========


A view per app.
---------------

How it must work:

- Connect to github.
- Read Vauxoo repositories.
- Look for modules marked as "Apps".
- Read the "Description".
- Show them in a page like "apps" in odoo.

1. An app marked as an app, read description, create the page, and then edit on
    line.
2. It must be done for official, for addons-vauxoo and OCA we need another
    approach.
